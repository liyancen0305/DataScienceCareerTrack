    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "         T-statistics is appropirate for this problem because the population variance is unkown. Also, permutation test is alse appropriate because this test is desinged for testing the null hypothesis of no difference between two groups. \n",
    "         The CLT apply because the sample size is 4870, which is large enough.\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses? Null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference of callback rate between black and white. The alternate hypethesis is that there is a significant difference of callback rate between black and white.\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches. The margin of error is 0.015. The confidence interval is within the range [0.01677, 0.0473]. By using bootstrapping approach, the p-value is 0.0002. By using frequentist approach, the p-value is even less, much closer to zero.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",
    "   Our analysis while statistically shows that whites and blacks definitely don't have the same callback rate because of the p-value being less than 0.05, it does not conclude that race/name is the most important factor in callback success, because we have not looked at other features like candiate history, criminal records, etc. Hence, we can conclude that there is a significant difference between race/name and callback success.\n",
